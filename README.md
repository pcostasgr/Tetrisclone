tetrisclone
===========

This is a tetris game clone in javascript and html5
I use canvas2D for rendering.
I am sure  that there are more effective tetromino algorithms than my implemantation.
I dont know anything about tetris literature so feel free to enlight me.
There is an issue with the rotation I'll fix it soon also I found out that there are different ways to represent them
ex http://tetris.wikia.com/wiki/Category:Rotation_Systems.
Enjoy
